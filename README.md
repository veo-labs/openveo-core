# OpenVeo

OpenVeo is a Node.js and AngularJS CMS. It embeds an HTTP server based on Express framework (Express) and a plugin loader mechanism.

The core of the system (i.e. without any plugin) offers a simple connection form to the administration interface.

This interface gives access to a limited set of default features:

- Users management
- Permissions and roles management
- Content group management
- Web service management
- A profile page
- Each plugin brings zero to many additive administration pages and zero to many additive public pages.
