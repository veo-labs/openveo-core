OpenVeo requires and is tested on:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (**&gt;16.3.0**) - The server side of OpenVeo is written in Node.js
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (**&gt;=7.15.1**) - NPM will help you install all OpenVeo dependencies
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) (**&gt;=4.2.0**) - OpenVeo stores all its datas inside a MongoDB database (users, roles, taxonomies etc.)

**NB:** Moreover, for a Windows installation, Visual Studio Express is required as some OpenVeo dependencies are written in C and need to be compiled. For Linux you may have to install the package libkrb5-dev.
