OpenVeo uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) coding standards. [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is used to validate coding rules. You can launch a code verification using the following command:

    npm run lint

**Nb :** Both Node.js and AngularJS parts of OpenVeo must respect the same coding standards
